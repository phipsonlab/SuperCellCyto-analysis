# Code

This folder contains the scripts used to generate the raw results that are
processed in the `Rmd` files in the `analysis` folder.
Please note that running some of these scripts will take a long time. 

## Content

The scripts for different sections of our paper is stored in its own folder:

* `explore_supercell_purity_clustering` for 
Supercells Preserve Biological Heterogeneity and Facilitate Efficient Cell Type Identification
* `b_cells_identification` for Identifying Rare B Cells Subsets by Clustering Supercells
* `batch_correction` for Mitigating Batch Effects in the Integration of Multi-Batch Cytometry Data at the Supercell Level
* `bodenmiller_data` for Recovery of Differentially Expressed Cell State Markers Across Stimulated and Unstimulated Human Peripheral Blood Cells
* `label_transfer` for Efficient Cell Type Label Transfer Between CITEseq and Cytometry Data

Refer to the content of the `Rmd` files in the `analysis` folder to work out
what each script in each folder is for.

# Data

This folder is meant for storing raw data, and its content is purposely not committed 
into the repository as they are enormous (over 10GB).

If you would like to reproduce our analysis, please download the content
from this cloud storage [TBC link] and place the files in your copy of `data` folder
before running `wflow_build()`.

Note, do not rename any folders or files, or move the folders around.

# Output

This folder is meant for storing the processed data 
generated by the scripts in the `code` folder.
Its content purposely not committed into the repository as they are enormous (over 30GB).

If you would like to reproduce our analysis, please download the content
from this cloud storage [TBC link] and place the files in your copy of `output` folder
before running `wflow_build()`.

Note, do not rename any folders or files, or move the folders around.
